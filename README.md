# RaBe Songticker

Songticker takes care of getting program associated data onto the airwaves.

This repository contains high level documentation and links to the individual components.

## Goals

The songticker gathers and aggregates real time data from the RaBe playout solutions and sends them to relevant stakeholders.

This includes sending DAB+ SLS+ data to our DAB+ provider and publishing data on the web for our website.

## Components

### [nowplaying daemon](https://radiorabe.github.io/nowplaying/)

The nowplaying daemon is the python server central to our songticker.
